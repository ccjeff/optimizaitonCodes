#### question 1

> A company produces two kinds of products. A product of the first type requires 1/6 hours of assembly labor, 1/2 hours of testing, and \$1.2 worth of raw materials. A product of the second type requires 1/4 hours of assembly, 1/6 hours of testing, and \$0.9 worth of raw materials. Given the current personnel of the company, there can be at most 90 hours of assembly labor and 80 hours of testing each day. Products of the first and second type have a market value of \$9 and \$8 respectively.
>
> (a)  Formulate a linear optimization that maximizes the daily profit of the company. (For simplicity, you do not need consider the completeness of products. That is, the variables may take float values.)
>
> (b)  Write the standard form of the LP you formulated in part (a)
>
> (c)  Consider the following modification to the original problem: Suppose that up to 40 hours of overtime assembly labor can be scheduled, at a cost of $8 per hour. Can it be easily incorporated into the linear optimization formulation and how?
>
> (d)  Solve the LP using MATLAB (for the original problem).

##### 1(a)

In this question, we have the following table: 

|           | Assembly Hours | Testing hours | Raw material | Market Value |
| --------- | :------------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Product A |      1/6       |      1/2      |    \$1.2     |      9       |
| Product B |      1/4       |      1/6      |    \$0.9     |      8       |

And we know that the total hours of assembly can be at most 90 hours and the total number of testing can at most be 80 hours.

The decision variables: the number of product A: $X_a$, the number of product B: $X_b$

Objective: Maximize the profit given by: $(9-1.2)*X_a + (8-0.9)* X_b = 7.8X_a + 7.2X_b$. 

 Constraints: 

- Total assembly labor hours: $\frac{1}{6}*X_a + \frac{1}{4}*X_b \leq 90$
- Total testing labor hours: $\frac{1}{2}*X_a + \frac{1}{6}*X_b \leq 80$
- $X_a \geq 0, X_b \geq 0$

##### 1(b)

To write this in standard LP form:
$$
minimize_{x_a, x_b} -(7.8X_a + 7.1X_b)\\
\begin{align}
subject\space to \space 
\frac{1}{6}X_a + \frac{1}{4}X_b + s = 90\\
\frac{1}{2}X_a + \frac{1}{6}X_b + t = 80\\
X_a, X_b, s, t \geq 0
\end{align}
$$
where $s$ and $t$ are slack variables

##### 1(c)

We can add a new decision variable $X_c$ to denote the amount of extra hours used after the 90 hours of assembly labor. We have our cost $X_c = ReLU(\frac{1}{6}X_a + \frac{1}{4}X_b - 90), where \space ReLU(x) = max(0,x)$
$$
minimize_{x_a, x_b} -(7.8X_a + 7.1X_b - 8X_c)\\
\begin{align}
subject\space to \space 
\frac{1}{6}X_a + \frac{1}{4}X_b + s = 130\\
\frac{1}{2}X_a + \frac{1}{6}X_b + t = 80\\
X_a, X_b, X_c, s, t \geq 0
\end{align}
$$

##### 1(d)

Here attached is the Python code:

```Python
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

# minimize c^Tx
# having Ax <= b
c = np.array([-7.8, -7.1])
A = np.array([[1/6, 1/4], [1/2, 1/6]])
b = [90,80]

x = cp.Variable(2)

prob = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(c.T@x),
                 [A @ x <= b, 
                 x >= 0])
prob.solve()

# Print result.
print("\nThe optimal value is", prob.value)
print("A solution x is")
print(x.value)
```

Optimal value at -2713.7, which means the largest profit is 2713.7, with the solution 51.4 and 325.7
